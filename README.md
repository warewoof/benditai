A Mobile Menu CMS

The benditai (本地台) CMS platform was designed and built to provide menu services for the countless restaurants in China that had yet to digitally published themselves.  In a country that leaped over the landline telephone directly to mobile, this platform provides a means to skip the static desktop website PDF menu and push the menus straight into the hands of 1 billion Chinese mobile users.

* Several Front-end mobile responsive web templates to choose from
* Basic JSON/XML formatted SOAP APIs to provide custom websites to hook to the menu data
