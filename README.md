A Mobile Menu CMS

http://benditai.com/en

This CMS platform was designed and built to provide menu services for the countless restaurants in (Shanghai) China that had yet to digitally published themselves.  In a country that leaped over the land-line telephone directly to mobile, this platform provides a means to skip the static desktop website PDF menu and jump straight into the hands of 1 billion Chinese mobile users.

Features of this platform include:
* Back-end menu and account manager built with Twitter Bootstrap on top of Yii framework
* Menu editor optimized for quick daily updates as common for restaurant food rotation
* Several Front-end mobile responsive web templates to choose from
* Basic JSON/XML formatted SOAP APIs to provide custom websites to hook to the menu data
* Analytics (using Piwik library and iframes) integrated into the menu editor
